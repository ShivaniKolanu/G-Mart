# G-Mart | The Online Grocery System


G-Mart provides user-friendly interface for people who want to buy groceries online and get them delivered home. On an everyday basis, people have to use a grocery shop to get their livelihood items. To buy the necessary products, people visit a grocery shop to collect the products from different shelves and then pay for the items and checkout. But many times this process does not seem very convenient. In their busy schedule they always forget to make time for grocery shopping.

Below is the schema diagram of the database architecture.
